Migrating items from TODO.txt ...

    * Distributed as a single Perl file rather than as a suite of
      modules & libraries.  It does require some external perl modules,
      one of which has a dependency on library.  The desire is to limit
      *this* distribution to a single utility program, though.

    * Process multiple shapefiles in a single invocation, layering
      the output into a single projected SVG file.

    * Accept per-source spatial reference system (SRS, i.e., projection)
      specs on the command line, allowing multiple input files to have
      disparate coordinate systems.

    * Project the results to any specified SRS.

    * Support specification of color and other rendering options,
      per source file.

    * Optionally select subset of shapes by regex on arbitrary data
      fields.

    * Support coloring of shapes by value of arbitrary data field, based
      on explicit value, groups of unique values, or range of numeric
      values.

    * Allow specification of a shapefile to use in scaling but not in
      rendering.  That could support independent production of layers
      to be later combined in an SVG editor.

    * Option for polygon and polylines to be rendered as a point at
      their center

    * Point shapes (or centers of polygons) may be plotted as one of a
      variety of built-in shapes: circle, square, diamond, 4-pointed star,
      or 5-pointed star.

    * Crop output to an arbitrary bounding box specified by the user in target
      units.
