Migrating items from TODO.txt ...


    * Process multiple shapefiles in a single invocation, layering
      the output into a single projected SVG file.

    * Accept per-source SRS specs on the command line, allowing multiple
      input files to have disparate coordinate systems.

    * Project the results to any specified SRS.

    * Support specification of color and other rendering options,
      per source

    * Optionally select subset of shapes by regex on arbitrary data
      fields.

    * Support coloring of shapes by value of arbitrary data field.

    * Allow specification of a shapefile to use in scaling but not in
      rendering.  That would support independent production of layers
      to be later combined in an SVG editor.

    * Option for polygon and polylines to be rendered as a point at
      their center
