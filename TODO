Wish to do list:

* Support islands in polygon shapes.  This is a major shortcoming.

* Automtatically-generated legend for range-colored shapes, as is already
  done with same-colored shapes.

* Include value from some data field in the SVG objects, either in the
  object ID or in another suitable field.  Possibly useful for automated
  post-processing.

* Replace use of SVG module with direct creation of the image file.

* Improve discovery of the projected bounding box.

* Specify a background color.

* Take a name from a field to print in the output.  Getting labels to
  print in a legible manner that doesn't interfere with the other items
  on a map is very problematical.  But if they're already in the image
  as an output option, it's easier to move them around in Inkscape than
  if you also had to type them in by hand first.

* Trace the outline of a group of shapes.  This one won't be too trivial;
  need a good algorithm or polygon library.

* Support some way of importing shapes for point shapes from external
  SVG files

* Scale and crop to a specific layer instead of the biggest, with an
  optional margin around the target layer.

* Support layers defined in text-delimited files (CSV, e.g.)

* Perhaps some-sort of config/description file to drive the program
  as an optional alternative to the burgeoning command-line.

* A GUI implemented in Perl-TK, some day?

* Automatically determine Source SRS from either .prj or .wkt files
