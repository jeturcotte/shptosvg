To do list:

* Include value from some data field in the SVG objects, either in the
  object ID or in another suitable field.

* Specify a background color.

* Take a name from a field to print in the output.  Getting labels to
  print in a legible manner that doesn't interfere with the other items
  on a map is very problematical.  But if they're already in the image
  as an output option, it's easier to move them around in Inkscape than
  if you had to type them in by hand to boot.

* Trace the outline of a group of shapes.  This one won't be trivial!

* Drawing point shapes with more than just circles by addeing
  more built-in shapes to select from in the inputspec

* Support some way of importing shapes for point shapes from external
  SVG files
